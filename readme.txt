== Description ==

This plugin collects social data (without slowing down your site!) and shows you which of your posts and authors are most popular based on how many times each post has been shared on various social networks.

Top Social Stories are your best posts, the most shared on social networks. This plugin gives you a social metrics tool to analyze and discover your most viral posts: you can see statistics about how many Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Pinterest, Linkedin and Vkontakte interactions you have every day for each post, each author and globally for all your site. When you install it wait some days to let the plugin collect data from social networks and then it will build ranks for authors and posts.

If you are you using social share buttons on your site, than you need this plugin to save data and monitor social interactions!
